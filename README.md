# Express API Project

This is a project in which the user can see a list of movies and tvshows that are available on Netflix.

## How to use the API

The API have a few different routes and endpoints in which the user can see information about movies and tvshows that are on the list. 
The routes are the following:

/shows --- in this endpoint the user can view the whole array of movies and tvshows. The user can search for a country and for a specific show with an id.

/movies --- this endpoint will only show all the movies in the array. Here the user can search for a specific movie to retrieve that item.

/tvshows --- this endpoint will only show all the tvshows in the array. Here the user can search for a specific tvshow to retrieve that item.


## What's next?

My next task is to build a frontend application which will function as a way to search and filter the API.
