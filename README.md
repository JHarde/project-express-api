# Express API Project

This is a project in which the user can see a list of movies and tvshows that are available on Netflix.

## How to use the API

The API have a few different routes and endpoints in which the user can see information about movies and tvshows that are on the list. 
The routes are the following:

/shows --- in this endpoint the user can view the whole array of movies and tvshows. The user can also search for a specific show with an id.

/shows/movies --- this endpoint will only show all the movies in the array. Here the user can search for a specific movie to retrieve that item.

/shows/tvshows --- this endpoint will only show all the tvshows in the array. Here the user can search for a specific tvshow to retrieve that item.

/shows/countries --- in this endpoint the user can retrieve tvshows and movies from a specific country by searching on that country.

## What's next?

My next task is to build a frontend application which will function as a way to search and filter the API.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
